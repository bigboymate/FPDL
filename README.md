# FPDL
Ensures your freedom by making sure that your software is actually yours.
The GPL is nice but it is a bit forceful. It may ensure the freedom of the
user but not the developer along with it. Then there is the idea that
licenses should be simple for easy reading and understanding for the layman.
That is where simple permissive licenses like MIT or ISC come in. They are 
exceptionally simple but say nothing about keeping source code open as they
focus on credit and a no warranty clause. An issue with these licenses is giving
people credit. When to do this is sometims pretty confusing especially since you had
only copied a do-while loop with error handling for opening files. The rest of the 
algorithm in the program is arguably yours, and what is considered
code theft requiring proper credit is subject to how cruel the project owner of the project
you took from is. This license aims to stop all of this.

This license aims to fix all of this. It is a public domain license so you can use whatever
source you want if they have this license, it encourages keeping software open and give credit
when they think have to, and it is simple. A mere 27 lines of text, explaining how this license
is itself in the public domain as well as everything under it, projects under it can be relicensed
(otherwise it wouldn't be truly in the public domain), and a requests section asking to keep
sources open along with giving credit at your own discretion. Real freedom means choice. 

The reason why it looks like a manpage is because I wanted to format it but I was lazy so I just
used groff's mdoc macros because it looked the most simple to write.
