     Free Public Domain License

PREAMBLE
     Nothing in this document is binding other than what is in the PERMISSIONS
     and LEGAL sections. Abiding by what is in the REQUESTS section is
     optional. This license is completely permissive and simply requests that
     the author keeps the source open and gives credit.

PERMISSIONS
     Both this document and works under this document are in the public
     domain. Permission is hereby granted to do what you will with both,
     including, but not limited to, modifying this document and relicensing
     works already under this document. All that's asked is for the REQUESTS
     section to be heeded, though that's not required.

REQUESTS
           1.   Keep all source code in this project open.
           2.   Give proper credit where it's due.

LEGAL
     The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
     or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantabil-
     ity, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event
     shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages or other liability,
     whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of
     or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the
     software.
