	KEEP OPEN PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSE
	     Version 1, June 2019

PREAMBLE
Nothing in this document is binding other than
statements in PERMISSIONS explaining that this
document and works under this document are in
the public domain. Abiding by what is under
REQUESTS is optional. This license is 
completely permissive and simply requests that
the author keeps the source open and gives
credit. A lack of fear helps foster a truly
open and creative community.

PERMISSIONS
Both this document and works under this document
are in the public domain. Permission is hereby
granted to do what you will with both, including,
but not limited to, modifying this document and
relicensing works already under this document.
All that's asked is for the REQUESTS section to
be heeded, though that's not required.

REQUESTS
Keep all source code in this project open.
Give proper credit where it's due.
