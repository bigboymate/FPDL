	KEEP OPEN PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSE
	    Version 1.0, June 2019

PREAMBLE
Nothing in this document is binding other than
statements in PERMISSIONS stating that this document
and works under this document are in the public
domain. The REQUESTS section is optional. All of
this is to keep source code truly free, to make
licensing simple, and to keep the free software
culture alive while still being radically permissive.
We should not be discouraged from working with others
because we don't like the licenses they use for
their projects. This is meant to change that.

PERMISSIONS
Both this document and works under this document
are in the public domain. As such, permission is 
hereby granted to do what you will with both,
including but not limited to relicensing works
already under this license. All that's asked is
for the REQUESTS section to be heeded, though
thats not required.

REQUESTS
Keep all source code in this project open.
Give proper credit where it's due.
